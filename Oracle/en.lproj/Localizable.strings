"1" = "His ideal woman loves people for who they are. You have to come to terms with his habits. Learn to adapt and be restrained.";

"2" = "His ideal girlfriend removes possessiveness from her heart. This feeling accompanies insecure people. A human's life belongs only to him. A person himself chooses with whom he can communicate, where he can go, what he needs to wear, how much time he can spend with friends. A sense of possessiveness and pathological jealousy gives rise to a desire to live up to fears.";

"3" = "His ideal girlfriend keeps track of her emotions. Low voice, calmness in difficult situations, the absence of stupid whims and resentments. If you feel irritated, walk away, catch your breath, close your eyes, take a couple of deep breaths and normalize your pulse.";

"4" = "His ideal girlfriend uses vanilla, lavender, musk scents. Perfume doesn't have to be cloyingly sweet.";

"5" = "His ideal girlfriend is graceful. During a date, it is important to monitor your posture and body movements. Arms crossed on the chest, rounded back, head bowed forward are unacceptable mistakes. It is important to constantly maintain your posture, avoid taking closed postures, and seek moderate eye contact. This does not mean that the guy needs to constantly look in the face. Excessive eye contact can be repulsive. Occasionally, you can correct naughty curls.";

"6" = "His ideal girlfriend is naturally beautiful. Pounds of make-up on the face repel men. You should do a simple make-up that will emphasize the natural beauty. It should be made natural¸ unobtrusive.";

"7" = "His ideal girlfriend remains feminine under any circumstances. When communicating, people tend to copy the behavior and speech patterns of the interlocutor, this helps to find a common language. If a man’s vocabulary contains a lot of swear words or slang, you should not repeat after him, this is contrary to female nature. This behavior repels the vast majority of men.";

"8" = "His ideal girlfriend knows her worth. Even if the object of sighing drives you crazy, it is worth remembering your own dignity. Pride is above everything.";

"9" = "His ideal girlfriend is moderately modest. Modesty adorns a girl, but excessive isolation can get boring. If you are cheerful with your chosen one, this will endear him to you.";

"10" = "His ideal is a mystery girl. Men love to conquer, and the longer the interlocutor guards her secrets, the better. You should not open up to a guy on the first date and talk about emotional wounds or former relationships.";

"11" = "His ideal girlfriend is inquisitive. Men run after only those women who, in addition to appearance, can captivate with strength of character and a rich inner world. Fill yourself with interesting hobbies, work on your habits and emotions, love your job and do what you love, get to know the world around you and your own world, analyze, share knowledge and develop in the chosen direction.";

"12" = "His ideal girl is always engaged in her development. Like a magnet, men are attracted to women who do not stop in their development, conquer new heights, break stereotypes and know what they want from life. If you have already achieved excellence in your profession, hobbies, or any other direction available to you, look for new ones.";

"13" = "His ideal girlfriend knows how to listen to her intuition. Listen to your nature, let it control you when you communicate with a man. Intuition will tell you where to give flirtatious notes to your voice, where to make a well-aimed \"shot\" with your eyes, and where to straighten your hair with your hands or \"accidentally\" touch a man's shoulder. To us, girl, these programs of seduction are given at birth.";

"14" = "His ideal girlfriend understands male nature. Do not complicate and do not think out men's actions. They have it easier. If they want something, they do it. If they don't want to, they won't even try.";

"15" = "His ideal girl finds happiness in the world around her and in herself. Pay more attention to the beauty of the sky, plants, flowers, buildings, animals, etc. Be interesting to yourself - find new hobbies, read books, communicate with people. When a girl is interesting to herself, she is interesting to men.";

"16" = "Being able to listen to your interlocutor is a real art. To build a strong relationship, a girl just needs to master this skill. Men, unlike girls, rarely need to speak out. When such a moment comes, and his girlfriend does not understand the full importance of what was said, the man withdraws into himself. Guys especially appreciate when their beloved girl is sincerely interested in his affairs, remembers all the important events for him, asks clarifying questions in order to have more complete information. Therefore, during communication, do not be afraid to ask about his friends, work, family. The main thing is that the questions should correspond to the topic of the conversation and not look like a list of questions in court.";
"17" = "His ideal girlfriend spends her time doing things that bring her pleasure. Find pleasure in everyday activities. For example, when you are cleaning, think about how much benefit you bring to your loved ones. Connect with people who are truly interesting to you. Explore and learn what really interests you.";
"18" = "You should not tell a man about past failures with guys, complain about their actions. A man comes to a woman for the energy of love and acceptance. He does not want to be a healer and heal the wounds inflicted by the \"ex\". He wants to share happiness and receive it in return.";
"19" = "If the guy who caused sympathy is in no hurry to get closer, do not force the onset of the romantic stage. Do not reproach, do not seduce, do not press with claims. Give the young man time, try to become his friend first.";

"20" = "His ideal girlfriend knows how to forgive, looks ahead and lives in the present.";

"21" = "Think of the guy's past close encounters with other girls as preparatory rehearsals. And yourself - as the final appearance on the stage. What happened in your life before him, including your personal life, these are your lessons.";
"22" = "His ideal girlfriend loves life. He loves all its manifestations: nature, relatives, communication with friends, study, work.";
"23" = "His ideal girlfriend listens to her heart. There are a lot of people around who are trying to impose their opinion, experience. It is easy to give advice to others, and even more so, to condemn others. What she trusts without a drop of doubt is her feelings.";
"24" = "His ideal girlfriend is calm and confident. In any situation, he does not panic, but trusts space and believes in the best. Able to analyze and make decisions.";
"25" = "His ideal girlfriend goes to her goal and follows her dreams. Moreover, she knows for sure that everything will be implemented, which means that with each new \"step\" her life will become better.";
"26" = "Find a common hobby. It is important for a couple to find the kind of hobbies that will bring drive to the life of two, give new impressions. Joy, pleasant emotions bring together and unite lovers.";
"27" = "His ideal girlfriend is constantly improving herself. There is no point in trying to change yourself for a RELATIONSHIP. There is no point in changing your partner. The only person you can change is YOU.";

"28" = "His ideal girlfriend knows how to listen to her intuition. Let your intuition save you from suffering. Trust and appreciate your own feminine wisdom.";

"29" = "His ideal girlfriend is always the way she is. The biggest mistake many girls make is that they want to please and learn how to behave with a guy too much, that they become not who they really are. Get rid of unnecessary thoughts, relax and love yourself for who you really are.";

"30" = "If after meeting with your man you want to sing and have fun - all is well; If you feel tired, slowed down, annoyed, offended, sad or some other negative emotions, as if strength is draining out of you, it’s worth seriously thinking: is this your person?";
"31" = "Any good relationship with a partner is work that is important to do daily so that they are strengthened. Listen to the opinion and desires of your partner, go for a compromise, if possible. Find common desires and goals.";

"32" = "His ideal girlfriend avoids obsession. Don't bother your man. Don't call or text 100 times a day. No, he will not decide what you think about him every minute, he will consider that you simply have nothing to do.";
"33" = "His ideal girlfriend needs him. Be sure to seek advice from your boyfriend. He must know that his opinion matters to you. In the end, he is a man, he must make decisions. Of course, this applies to those issues in which he is competent; it is better to leave the discussion of the new manicure for a conversation with a girlfriend. A man should constantly be given the opportunity to prove that he is a hero. And do not forget to thank for the help.";

"34" = "His ideal girlfriend is not offended by trifles. Girls are very sensitive and react sharply to everything that happens. At that time, as you carefully consider the plan of revenge for the next mistake, a man may not even guess about the reasons for your anger.";

"35" = "His ideal girlfriend knows how to express her desires. Men do not have such a subtle intuition as girls, and do not know how to read minds. Learn to tell your boyfriend exactly what you want. Subtle hints often do not help: if you need something, then the exact formulation will significantly increase the chances of getting what you want.";

"36" = "Girls are often more emotional than men. You should understand that if a guy does not repeat to you every half hour how much he loves you, this does not mean that he does not have any feelings for you. You don’t need to pull confessions out of him, pay attention to actions. If a man is ready to pay attention to you, to spend time solving your problems, this will be the best proof that you are important to him.";

"37" = "Avoid criticism. Constant attempts to prove that you are smarter will lead to the fact that your partner will stop consulting with you and being interested in your opinion. It is much more important to learn how to delicately suggest a possible solution to a problem and offer help when it is needed.";

"38" = "Spend time together. Common interests make it possible to develop relationships and bring something new to them, and the emotions experienced together make the couple's life brighter. But this does not mean that you need to completely abandon your own hobbies, completely replacing them with those things that your partner loves. Everyone has the right to their hobby, you must respect this right and you can count on the same attitude towards yourself. If your interests are radically different, find something that you would like to do together.";

"39" = "Tolerance and understanding are the basis of a long relationship. Every person has their own shortcomings, and it is better to decide at the beginning whether you are ready to accept them. If you don't like non-punctual people, and your partner constantly arrives for a meeting with you late, you have two options: either look for another candidate for the role of a loved one, or forgive him for his inability to plan time.";
"40" = "Try to make friends with his family and friends. They most likely mean a lot to your boyfriend, he appreciates their opinion, including about you. Respectfully communicate with his parents and try to please them. Or better yet, make friends.";
"41" = "Be a positive person. Any guy will fall in love with you much faster if you enjoy what you do and enjoy the things that surround you. If you tell him about how you like your hobbies, studies or work, his interest in you will increase.";
"42" = "Take a look at your chosen one. Perhaps you just do not fit each other because of a mismatch of temperaments, traits of character brought up from childhood, or simply because of a lack of love between you? You don’t need to focus on a specific person: if you see that he doesn’t suit you, dating just to have someone around doesn’t make sense.";
"43" = "Love yourself. If you don't love yourself, no one can love you. If you want a guy to fall in love with you, you need to love yourself and be proud of yourself. Try the following:\nUnderstand where your strengths lie. Think of five things that make you stand out from the crowd and write them down if you feel comfortable doing so. Then use them to your advantage. Try to show your strengths as often as possible. For example, if you know you have a good sense of humor, let the guy notice.\nWork on your weaknesses. Loving yourself doesn't mean you're perfect. If you can identify at least three of your shortcomings, you will love yourself even more when you can correct them.";
"44" = "Work on your confidence. If you work on your appearance, love what you do, and start appreciating yourself, your self-confidence will instantly increase. If you're confident and comfortable with being yourself, a guy will be quicker to figure out how he feels about you. To make your self-confidence visible to others, be prepared to stand up for yourself and laugh at yourself from time to time.\nRemember that being confident and being arrogant are two different things. If you keep talking about how beautiful you are, it will turn people off.";
"45" = "Get ready for adventure. People who are fun to be around like to get out of their comfort zone. Are you afraid to ride a unicycle, learn to dance the foxtrot or go hiking? Well, turn your fear into positive energy and your life will become more interesting.";
"46" = "You should look like you are enjoying everything that happens. To become the center of attention at a party, be cheerful, gesticulate, joyfully greet old friends. If you become the funniest person in the room, the guy will definitely notice you.";
"47" = "Be a cheerful girl. If you want a guy to love you, you need to learn how to love life and yourself. Smile when you meet, laugh with friends. If you radiate fun, you will attract people and many will want to spend time with you because you know exactly how to have fun.";

Цель - вычеркнуть как можно больше чисел, чтобы конечная сумма оставшихся была минимальна! Может случиться такое, что сумма оставшихся чисел слишком велика, это означает, что ты вложила не достаточно усилий и энергии в гадание, и числовая последовательность не получила энергетику для связи с вашими отношениями.";

";

Если же все все пары найдены, то гадалка перейдет к следующему ходу: перепишет оставшиеся числа под именем и процедуру нужно будет продолжить. Шагов может быть много, гадалка будет переписывать их до тех, пока не останется рядом стоящих пар. Сумма оставшихся чисел будет ключем к гаданию . Гадалка расскажет тебе все мысли твоего избранника!";
